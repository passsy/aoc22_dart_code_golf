# Advent of Code 2022 in Dart (Code Golf)

This is my attempt at solving the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles in the shortest possible code using [Dart](https://dart.dev/) `2.18`.

You can find the solution in `/bin`.

I created `.min.dart` file containing the shortest possible code for each puzzle.

The normal `dart` files are the same code I used to solve the puzzles in the first place before starting to code golf the solutions.

## Rules

- The Dart program has to have a `main(List<String> args)` entrypoint.
- The input is read from file and passed into the `main` function line by line.
- External dependencies are not allowed.
- The output is printed via `print()`

See the [`mainTester()`](https://github.com/passsy/aoc22_dart_code_golf/blob/main/test/main_tester.dart) function as reference
