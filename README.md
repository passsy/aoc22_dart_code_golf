# Advent of Code 22 in Dart (Code Golf)

This is my attempt at solving the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) puzzles in the shortest possible code using [Dart](https://dart.dev/) `2.18`.

You can find the solution in `/bin`.

I created `.min.dart` file containing the shortest possible code for each puzzle.

The normal `dart` files are the same code I used to solve the puzzles in the first place before starting to code golf the solutions.


## Results
